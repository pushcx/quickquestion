# Ruby 3.4 will move csv out of stdlib; httparty 0.22.0 depends on it without a version, bundler is
# confused/mad there is a stdlib and gem version at the same time, warning:
#     WARN: Unresolved or ambiguous specs during Gem::Specification.reset:
#           csv (>= 0)
#           Available/installed versions of this gem:
#           - 3.3.0
#           - 3.2.8
#     WARN: Clearing out unresolved specs. Try 'gem cleanup <gem>'
#     Please report a bug if this causes problems.
# requiring csv here silences it and I refuse to keep digging
